# Creating an Extension

## System Requirements

Before creating an extension make sure the following requirements are met.

* You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.10 or higher installed.
* You have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

## Starting a New Extension

CodeEdit makes it easy to create a new extension project using the **Extensions** menu. To get started choose **Extensions > New Extension…**, which will open a Save dialog prompting you to select a location for your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Extension Developer Account**

It is not necessary to have a CodeEdit developers account if you have no intention of offering the extension on the Extension Store. However, an account is required to publish an extension and make it publicly available. See [Publishing an Extension](publishing-an-extension.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## File and Folder Structure

Every extension project is created with the default file and folder structure shown below.

```
.
├── assets/
│   └── icon.png
├── node_modules/
│   └── ... 
├── src/
│   └── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

* **assets/** contains all images used by the extension, which will be bundled with the extension and accessible at runtime. Every extension should also include an `icon.png` file to be displayed in the CodeEdit UI and extension store.
* **node\_modules/** contains the project dependencies. Its contents should not be manually altered. Instead, to add a dependency use `package.json` and npm.
* **src/** contains the project source files in JavaScript (.js, .jsx) or TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) format.&#x20;
* **src/index.js** serves as the main entrypoint for the extension. See the [index.js](creating-an-extension.md#extension-entrypoint) section below to learn more.
* **.gitignore** includes a list of files and folders to be ignored by Git version control. See the Git documentation for more information.
* **CHANGELOG.md** includes information about changes made in each version of the extension. This file should be written in Markdown and will be displayed in the extension store alongside details included in `README.md` when the extension is published.
* **package.json** is a manifest file that with metadata about the extension. It is also used to add extension dependencies. See the [package.json](creating-an-extension.md#manifest-file) section below to learn more.
* **package-lock.json** is a file generated by npm containing detailed information about the dependencies used, such as the exact version of a package that is installed. Do not manually alter this file

## package.json

The `package.json` extension manifest file is a superset of the npm `package.json` file so only a single file is required to configure your extension. Please refer to the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) for more information.

| description  | Yes      | A single sentence describing the extension.                                             |
| icon         | Yes      | An icon for the extension. See our icon specifications.                                 |
| author       | Yes      | The username of who built the extension.                                                |
| categories   | Yes      | The categories that apply to this extension. See a list of our extension categories.    |
| commands     | Yes      | An array of commands that are offered by this extension. See Command Properties.        |
| contributors | No       | A list of usernames of contributors of this extension.                                  |

| preferences  | No       | An array of preferences that are offered by this extension. See Preferences Properties. |

## index.js

The `index.js` file serves as the main entrypoint for the extension. It should export two methods, `activate` and `deactivate`. The `activate` method is called only once when the [Activation Event](../activation-events.md) specified in `extension.json` has occurred.

```javascript
import * as codeedit from 'codeedit';

// Method is called once when the extension is first activated.
export function activate() {
  // Instantiate extension object.
  let myCompletionProvider = new myCompletionProvider();
  
  // Register the extension object.
  codeedit.extensions.registerCompletionProvider(myCompletionProvider);
}

export function deactivate() {
  // Add any code that should be run when the extension stops running.
}
```
