# Language Server

LSP, or [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), is a specification developed by Microsoft that is used to add common features to an editor or IDE. Features include code completion, go to definition, and hover documentation for specific languages.

So, why use a Language Server? It makes it easier to add language support to multiple development tools.

{% hint style="info" %}
A Language Server is an alternative approach to implementing features described elsewhere in the CodeEdit API documentation, such as code completion, and hover documentation.
