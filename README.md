# Introduction

## Overview

CodeEdit supports core languages and markup out-of-the-box, including HTML, JavaScript, and Markdown. Its user interface was designed to give developers a familiar and consistent Mac-like experience.

Understandably, most developers will need support for other languages, require additional features, and have unique preferences. To meet these needs CodeEdit provides a robust JavaScript and React extension API.

If you are new to extension development or would like to become familiar with the basics of creating and publishing extensions for CodeEdit, we highly recommend reading our [Getting Started](getting-started/creating-an-extension.md) page. To learn more about building different specific types of extensions, see the [Guides](broken-reference) section. For those wanting to jump right in and browse the exposed functionality, visit the [API](broken-reference) section. &#x20;

If you run into problems along the way, please reach out to our dedicated extension community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vChUXVf9Em).
